<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The repository is the means to share data and make it machine
  readable, enhancing most educational software by virtue of its 
  access to more materials and, just as importantly, to access those
  materials most pertinent to the student's current needs.</li>
  <li>Specialty software which currently requires teachers to rekey
  or otherwise manipulate the educational materials can be much
  easier for users when they can reuse material from the repository.</li>
  <li>Ready access to data should incentivize experiments in new methods
  or situations for learning.</li>
</ul>
