<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There's plenty of room for commercial involvement, centrally or at the margins.</li>
  <li>The software to make educational materials available to client
  software is open source and can be used for any purpose.  For example,
  an educational material vendor such as a textbook publisher with on-line
  materials can use the software on their own servers to provide their 
  educational materials with restricted access, allowing teachers, students, 
  and parents covered by a license or other agreement to access the proprietary
  materials using software of their choice, not just software provided by the
  vendor.</li>
</ul>
