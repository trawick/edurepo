<h2>Teachers,</h2>

<p>In order for you and your student families to make best use of
the system, we need you to maintain a calendar showing the current
learning objective(s) for your classes which participate in the
project.  Easy to use software will make this quick, and in a short
time you can lay out projected progress over the coming days or
weeks and easily adjust it later.</p>

<p>You and your student families will then be able to use different 
software to access materials relevant to the current learning
objectives.</p>

<p>See the demo on the <a href="#/forParents">parents</a> page.</p>

<p>If you are teaching a course which is not yet defined in the
system, you and your colleagues can collaborate on defining it.</p>

<p>You are also <a href="#/forAuthors">authors of materials</a>.</p>
