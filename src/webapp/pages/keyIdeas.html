<h3>The learning objectives from the course curriculum are the focus of communication
and automation.</h3>

<h4>Support for a course offering starts with a definition of the curriculum, made up
of a series of learning objectives.</h4>

<p>The curriculum for a course and each learning objective has a unique identifier.</p>

<h4>Support materials are all accessible by learning objective.</h4>

<p>A teacher, student, or parent who has the identifier for a learning
objective access resources of many different types which are pertinent
to that objective.</p>

<p>A teacher who uses software to maintain the current learning objectives
for each class (a simple type of calendar) enables parents to quickly
access resources specific to the work their child is studying right now
at school.</p>

<p>In short, communication of the identifier for the learning objective 
avoids confused parent-student discussions about what the student did
in a class, as well as streamlines access to related resources.</p>

<h3>A shared repository for learning materials, accessible by learning
objective, supports free access and collaboration.</h3>

<p>A simple way to think of this is as a WikipediA for educational materials,
where anyone can contribute additions or improvements, and anyone can access
the materials.</p>

<p>Accessibility by learning objective allows teachers, students, and
parents to quickly find relevant resources.</p>

<p>Existing materials can be added to the repository if they are
contributed by the owners of the material and they can be associated with
existing learning objectives.</p>

<p>Educators creating new materials to share can rely on the shared
repository to maintain them and allow them to reach a large audience.</p>

<h3>The resources in the repository are machine readable with open, online access
from any client software.</h3>

<p>The mechanisms for accessing the resources will be documented so that
software authors and vendors can support reuse of the information.</p>

<p>The types of software that may reuse the resources are essentially
unlimited.  Consider a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Flashcards and games</li>
  <li>Quiz and test generators</li>
  <li>Crowd-sourced indexes of relevant resources</li>
</ul>

<p>Software for smartphones, tablets, web sites, computers, and specialty
devices will make relevant educational materials ubiquitous.</p>
