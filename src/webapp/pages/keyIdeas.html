<h2>Background</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Your student's 5th period math class, for example, follows a <em>course curriculum</em>.</li>
  <li>The <em>course curriculum</em> consists primarily of specific <em>learning objectives</em>
to be achieved in the course.</li>
  <li>Teachers, students, and parents use many types of educational resources &mdash; text, videos,
worksheets, games, etc. &mdash; in the
context of a specific <em>learning objective</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Existing problems to be addressed</h2>

<ol>
  <li>a large amount of duplicate effort on the part of teachers preparing or adjusting materials
(even <em>cutting and pasting</em>) to consume in software ranging from Microsoft Word to
Quizlet</li>
  <li>difficulties for parents to understand current objectives, often making it impractical
for parents to follow the progress of classes and discuss class topics in a meaningful way</li>
  <li>ineffective systems created by states and private groups to index available materials,
which do not allow direct access to materials which are relevant to current study</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key features of the project</h2>

<ol>
  <li>The current learning objectives for a class are easily communicated by the teacher
to students and parents.</li>
  <li>The system provides a repository for various types of educational materials, all
supporting targeted access by learning objective.  <em>A very important type of material
is the course curriculum itself.</em>  Teachers will be able to use the repository to
collaborate on and reuse materials without the burden of self publishing.</li>
  <li>Users of the system will be able to promote outside resources which apply to
specific learning objectives.</li>
  <li>All materials in the system are freely available by end users and, more importantly,
by end user software.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Expected outcome of the project</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Relating all materials to specific learning objectives will allow teachers, students,
and parents to quickly find appropriate materials.  <em>For parents specifically, it will
become much more easy to track exactly what their children are currently working on, and
quickly find information to help them with their homework.</em></li>
  <li>Teachers will have a much easier means to communicate general class activity to parents.</li>
  <li>The open access of the system will support a rich ecosystem with incentives to educators
of collaborate on materials and incentives to software developers to offer creative ways
to use them.</li>
</ol>

<h2>In short</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Software for smartphones, tablets, web sites, computers, game systems,
and specialty devices will make relevant educational materials ubiquitous.
Whether a child studied the Pythagorean theorem, the Napoleonic Wars,
or the conjugation of common French verbs at school today, it should not
take more than a few taps on her parent's smartphone or computer to access
relevant materials and start a conversation about it.</li>
  <li>Teachers who donate materials to the system will enable those materials
to be consumed in many different ways by students all over the world.</li>
</ul>
