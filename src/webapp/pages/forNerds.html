<h2>Nerds,</h2>

<p>We have a lot of work to do.  Conceptually there are two
separate projects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the software and infrastructure to maintain and enhance the
  repository of educational materials, including curriculum
  definitions</li>

  <li>the software and infrastructure to serve the educational 
  materials in the repository as well as provide extra services such as
  a teacher database for maintaining current objectives by class</li>
</ol>

<p>Some older information is available in
<a href="https://github.com/trawick/edurepo/tree/master/docs">a docs directory on Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Repository of materials</h3>

<p>The repository must support direct use by someone with a local copy
of the data, though not necessarily using end user software.
It must be easy for a user or institution to maintain an up to date copy.
It must track all changes to the data through history.  Storage
as directories and plain text files in a general purpose DVCS is the expected
solution.</p>

<p>All contributors must be assured that, in the event the machine-
readable project is cancelled, the educational materials will still be
available and usable by other projects.</p>

<p>All users must be able to use the materials under simple terms.</p>

<h3>Access to the repository over the web</h3>

<p>The repository of materials is imported into a database for quick
access.  REST APIs will be provided for end user software to interact
with the system.</p>

<p>Additional applications and databases support ease of use of the
educational materials, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>registration of specific classes (e.g., Mrs. Smith's 2nd period
  freshman biology) with learning objectives recorded by date, to
  enable tracking by parents of exactly what their kids are studying</li>
  <li>crowdsourced indexes to resources elsewhere, organized by
  learning objective and type of material</li>
</ul>
