<p>Nerds, there's a lot of work to do.  Conceptually there are two
separate pieces to work on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>the software and infrastructure to maintain and enhance the
  repository of educational materials, including curriculum
  definitions</li>

  <li>the software and infrastructure to serve the educational 
  materials in the repository as well as extra services such as
  a teacher database for maintaining current objectives by class</li>
</ol>

<p>Some older information is available at <a href="https://github.com/trawick/edurepo/tree/master/docs">a docs directory on Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Repository</h3>

<p>The repository has to be able to be used directly by someone with
a local copy of the data.  It must be easy to maintain an up to date
copy.  It must track all changes to the data through history.  For
this reason it will be made up of directories and files in a DVCS.</p>

<p>All contributors must be assured that, in the event the machine-
readable project is cancelled, the educational materials will still be
available and usable by other projects.</p>

<p>All users must be able to access the materials under simple terms.</p>

<h3>Access to the repository over the web</h3>
