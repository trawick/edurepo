<p>Curriculum designers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The formal curriculum description moves closer to the forefront
  of the conversation around individual classes and educational materials
  because the individual
  learning objectives in the formal curriculum description are the key
  to communication of activities between teachers and parents.</li>
  <li>The formal description, "I Can" statements, and informal
  descriptions of individual objectives will be viewed by all
  <em>involved</em> parties via the central use of the objectives.</li>
  <li>From the curriculum designers we need an outline of each course
  with different types of information around each objective.</li>
</ul>


<p>Creators of educational materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Educators who contribute material to the repository will be
  able to reuse it in a variety of software.</li>
  <li>The material must be freely available under common terms, 
  similar to material in Wikipedia.</li>
  <li>Not all materials are of a form suitable for inclusion in the
  repository, but the index to outside resources can be used to relate
  the materials to specific objectives.</li>
</ul>
