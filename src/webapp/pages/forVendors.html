<p>Software vendors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The repository is the means to share data and make it machine
  readable, enhancing most educational software by virtue of its 
  access to more materials and, just as importantly, to access those
  materials most pertinent to the student's current needs.</li>
  <li>Specialty software which currently requires teachers to rekey
  or otherwise manipulate the educational materials can be much
  easier for users when they can reuse material from the repository.</li>
  <li>Ready access to data should incentivize experiments in new methods
  or situations for learning.</li>
</ul>

<p>Education vendors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There's plenty of room for commercial involvement, centrally or at the margins.</li>
  <li>The software to make educational materials available to client
  software is open source and can be used for any purpose.  For example,
  an educational material vendor such as a textbook publisher with on-line
  materials can use the software on their own servers to provide their 
  educational materials with restricted access, allowing teachers, students, 
  and parents covered by a license or other agreement to access the proprietary
  materials using software of their choice, not just software provided by the
  vendor.</li>
</ul>
