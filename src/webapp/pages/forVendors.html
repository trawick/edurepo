<h2>Educational software vendors,</h2>

<p>Your software is the key to making current school activities school
pervasive in family interactions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The repository is the means to share data and make it machine
  readable, potentially enhancing your software by virtue of its 
  access to more materials and, just as importantly, to access those
  materials most pertinent to the student's current needs.</li>
  <li>Specialty software which currently requires teachers to rekey
  or otherwise manipulate the educational materials can be much
  easier for users when they can reuse material from the repository.</li>
  <li>Easy access to materials will provide incentives for experiments in new methods
  or situations for learning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Textbook publishers and other vendors of educational materials,</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The software to make educational materials available to client
  software is open source and can be used for any purpose.  For example,
  an educational material vendor such as a textbook publisher with on-line
  materials can use the software on their own servers to provide their 
  educational materials with restricted access, allowing teachers, students, 
  and parents covered by a license or other agreement to access the proprietary
  materials using software of their choice, not just software provided by the
  vendor.</li>
  <li>Making your materials available with the same access mechanisms as
  the free materials will allow them to be used with more end user software.</li>
</ul>
