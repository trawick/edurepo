<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<h3>Who are you, and why are you doing this?</h3>

<p>My name is Jeff Trawick and I am a software developer located in
Raleigh, North Carolina.  I believe that the application of
relatively simple technology and open software culture can
improve the effectiveness of existing efforts on the part of educators,
and that any such improvement is valuable to society.</p>

<h3>Can I use this?</h3>

<p>Yes, of course.  Download the software from 
<a href="https://github.com/trawick/edurepo">https://github.com/trawick/edurepo</a>
and deploy the software on your server, define your courses, load databases with
resources applicable to your learning objectives, and so forth.</p>

<h4>No, really...</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, you're correct; it isn't feasible for most people to do that.  You need 
someone else to maintain the computer resources that make it work, with
minimal effort on your part.</p>

<p>As long as your course is generally useful and you or someone else is
willing to publish formal course descriptions and possibly additional materials
for the learning objectives of the course, you will be able to use a publicly-accessible
server for your class.</p>

<p>If your course contains private materials or isn't generally useful to
others, you'll need to run your own server or pay a vendor to provide that
as a service.</p>

<p>Most K-12 and college courses are examples of courses that will
find a home in a freely available, publicly accessible server.</p>

<p>Religious instruction courses and courses containing proprietary
information are examples of courses that would require the use of a
different server.</p>

<h4>When can I get involved?</h4>

<p>Feel free to contact me when it reaches a level of implementation
that is useful to you.  Here's the current plan:</p>

<h5>April 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>at least one commonly used K-12 course represented well enough
in the system to be able to experiment with the entire system</li>
</ul>

<h5>May 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>dedicated servers for edjective.org</li>
  <li>create one or more mailing lists to discuss different aspects of the
system</li>
</ul>

<h5>June 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>end user software has enough working features for early adopters to
commit to using the system in the upcoming school year</li>
</ul>

<h5>July 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>API documentation for other software authors/vendors to use</li>
  <li>effort to convince authors of existing software, especially
freely available software that many teachers use, to support retrieval
of information from the system</li>
</ul>

<h5>August 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>at least four commonly used K-12 courses properly defined in the system</li>
  <li>additional course definitions and related offerings, subject to ability
of course sponsor to handle most of the work</li>
  <li>operational capacity to support at least 50 individual course offerings
(i.e., about 1500 students), with plans for scaling out to support more</li>
</ul>

<h3>I need a service level agreement, or at least to see it work reliably for a long time, 
before committing to using this</h3>

<p>It is no secret that web based software may not always support the number
of people that want to use it.  Unfortunately, this is not an operation
that can afford to make available limitless engineering or server resources to
handle any possible demand.  We will have to grow with demand and with the ability
to pay for resources.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a school system has the ability to provide dedicated servers for
the use of their students, largely avoiding the unpredictable impact
of the use of public systems by unknown numbers of students across the world.
The school system can control the use of the servers (by limiting the number
of classes) to match the server resources they are able to allocate to it.  Please
contact me for more information about this.</p>

<p>Over time the public server will evolve to predictably, reliably support a
very large number of users.</p>

<h3>What happens if Jeff quits working on this?</h3>

<p>The software and educational materials are and will be freely licensed.
The educational materials will be stored in machine readable format even
without using this particular software.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that this project can survive independent of any particular
individuals, I will promote the following:</p>

<ul>
   <li>The software components should be maintained as a largely independent
project which is part of an existing non-profit organization with the cultural, technical,
legal, and financial ability to support ongoing development and maintenance by
interested parties.  (<em>something like the Apache Software Foundation</em>)</li>
   <li>The educational materials themselves should be maintained separately by
a new or existing non-profit organization that can provide the appropriate culture
and other resources.  This same organization should operate the definitive
servers which make the materials readily accessible to as many people as possible.
  (<em>something like the Wikimedia Foundation</em>)</li>
   <li>Even though it is crucial to provide the core services without cost to
anyone who can make use of it, the ability of individuals and vendors to profit from
involvement in the ecosystem should be respected, with the profit incentive seen 
as an important aspect of long term survival.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Money and resources</h3>

<h4>Who is paying for this work?</h4>

<p>Over the coming months, a small number of educators who hope to use the
system will work on educational materials, either as volunteers or as part 
of their jobs or course work.</p>

<p>Software development is currently unfunded, and likely to be impacted
by other limits on my time.  I am working on this on a 100% volunteer basis.</p>

<h4>How can I help?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Sponsor educators who are volunteering their time to define courses
and provide materials for the system.</li>
  <li>Sponsor me or other software developers.</li>
  <li>Starting in May 2014: Volunteer to help with course definitions,
provide educational materials, or work on the software.</li>
</ul>
