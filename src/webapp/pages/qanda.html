<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<h3>Who are you, and why are you doing this?</h3>

<p>My name is Jeff Trawick and I am a software developer located in
Raleigh, North Carolina.  I believe that this application of
relatively common technology and the infusion of open software, open
information culture can greatly improve the effectiveness of 
existing efforts to develop and share course materials and communicate
current lessons to parents, especially at the middle school and
high school levels, when parents find it increasingly difficult to
understand how they can contribute to their children's understanding
of current activities.</p>

<h3>Can I use this?</h3>

<p>Yes, of course.  Download the software from 
<a href="https://github.com/trawick/edurepo">https://github.com/trawick/edurepo</a>
and deploy the software on your server, define your courses, load databases with
resources applicable to your learning objectives, and so forth.</p>

<h4>No, really...</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, you're correct; it isn't feasible for most people to do that.  You need 
someone else to maintain the computer resources that make it work, with
minimal effort on your part.</p>

<p>As long as your course is generally useful and you or someone else is
willing to publish formal course descriptions and possibly additional materials
for the learning objectives of the course, you will be able to use a publicly-accessible
server for your class.</p>

<p>If your course contains private materials or isn't generally useful to
others, you'll need to run your own server or pay a vendor to provide that
as a service.</p>

<p>Most K-12 and college courses are examples of courses that will
find a home in a freely available, publicly accessible server.</p>

<p>Religious instruction courses and courses containing proprietary
information are but two examples of courses that would require the use of a
privately funded server.  (But the software itself is freely available for any
purpose.)</p>

<h4>When can I get involved?</h4>

<p>Feel free to contact me when it reaches a level of implementation
that is useful to you.  Here's the current plan:</p>

<h5>April 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>At least one commonly used K-12 course will be represented well enough
to be able to validate many aspects of the system.</li>
  <li>A blog will be used to communicate improvements to interested parties.</li>
</ul>

<h5>May 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>edjective.org will have dedicated servers.</li>
  <li>Mailing lists will be available to discuss different aspects of the
system.</li>
</ul>

<h5>June 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>End user software will have sufficient features to make the system worthwhile
for use in the upcoming school year, even though software from third parties
will not yet be available.</li>
  <li>Server deployment instructions for institutions wishing to run their own
servers will be ready for early adopters.</li>
</ul>

<h5>July 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>API documentation will be available for other software authors/vendors so 
that their software can interact with the system.</li>
  <li>Make an effort to convince authors of existing software, especially
freely available software that many teachers use, to interact with 
the system.</li>
</ul>

<h5>August 2014</h5>

<ul>
  <li>At least four commonly used K-12 courses will be defined in the system,
with an initial set of materials and external resources defined.</li>
  <li>Additional course definitions and related materials may be available
subject to the ability of the course sponsor to handle most of the work.</li>
  <li>The edjective.org servers will have the operational capacity to support
at least 50 individual course offerings (i.e., about 1500 students), with plans
for scaling out to support more students if funds are available.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How do I know the servers will handle the load if I commit to using this?</h3>

<p>It is no secret that web based software does not always support the number
of people that want to use it.  Unfortunately, edjective.org does not currently
have available the limitless engineering and server resources to
handle any possible demand.  We will have to grow with demand and with the ability
to pay for resources.</p>

<p>A school system can mitigate any risk of server availability by setting up 
dedicated servers for the use of their students, largely avoiding the unpredictable
impact
of the use of public systems by unknown numbers of students across the world.
The school system can control the use of its servers by limiting the number
of classes using it to match the server resources they are able to allocate.</p>

<p>Over time the public server will evolve to predictably, reliably support a
very large number of users, just like other resources we use daily on the
internet.</p>

<h3>What happens if Jeff quits working on this?</h3>

<p>The software and educational materials are freely licensed.
The educational materials are maintained in machine readable format suitable
for use even without using the software developed for this project.</p>

<p>In order to ensure that this project can survive independent of any particular
individuals, I will promote the following:</p>

<ul>
   <li>The software components should be maintained as a largely independent
project which is part of an existing non-profit organization with the cultural, technical,
legal, and financial ability to oversee ongoing development and maintenance by
interested parties (<em>something like the Apache Software Foundation</em>).</li>
   <li>The educational materials themselves should be maintained separately by
a new or existing non-profit organization that can provide the appropriate culture
and other resources suitable for educational materials and the community which
maintain them; this may be very different than an open source software community.
This same organization should operate the definitive servers which make the materials 
freely accessible to as many people as possible (<em>something like the Wikimedia 
Foundation</em>).</li>
   <li>Even though it is crucial to provide the core services without cost to
anyone, the ability of individuals and vendors to profit from
involvement in the ecosystem must be maintained; this provides a powerful
incentive to contribute
directly to the projects as well as to provide new types of end user software that can
provide a better experience for teachers, parents, and students.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Money and resources</h3>

<h4>Who is developing this?</h4>

<p>Over the coming months, a small number of educators who hope to use the
system will work on educational materials, either as volunteers or as part 
of their jobs or course work.</p>

<p>I am the sole software developer at present, and my time will likely be impacted
by the need to perform unrelated work for hire.</p>

<h4>How can I help?</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Sponsor educators who are volunteering their time to define courses
and provide materials for the system.</li>
  <li>Sponsor me or other developers who are building the software.</li>
  <li>Volunteers, refer to the rough schedule above for when different parts
of the system will be available, and contact me if there is some way that
you would like to help.</li>
</ul>
