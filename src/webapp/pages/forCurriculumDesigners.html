<p>In short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The formal curriculum description moves closer to the forefront
  of the conversation around individual classes and educational materials
  because the individual
  learning objectives in the formal curriculum description are the key
  to communication of activities between teachers and parents.</li>
  <li>The formal description, "I Can" statements, and informal
  descriptions of individual objectives will be viewed by all
  <em>involved</em> parties via the central use of the objectives.</li>
  <li>From the curriculum designers we need an outline of each course
  with different types of information around each objective.</li>
</ul>
