** Jan 29: I've been thinking about this for a couple of weeks, talked over the ideas with a family member who teaches
in a college of education, written up a couple of ideas (see docs subdirectory), and shared them with another education
faculty member with experience in this area.

Next steps: Determine a set of features for an initial prototype (see README.md), implement it.  Look for existing
resources with similar capabilities.
