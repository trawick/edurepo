Current stage (by Feb ??)
=========================

???

Possible themes for upcoming stages
===================================

* Refactor controllers.js
* Customize Django admin for easier use
* Create reference views of repo data
* XML scheme/validation for repo data
* Model for multiple choice questions (exploit in demo)
* Add Spanish version of some "I Can" statements or other materials, with means of retrieval
* should teacher models specify separate base URLs for contributed resources vs. the repo? (TODO parent demo and sample code should use repo provider URL from class model)

Blatant bugs, even obvious at this early stage
==============================================

* need ASL in source files
* web app should cache server lookups for better performance
* individual items have ids for reuse with multiple objectives?  I dunno...  seems to imply performance hit, when the materials could be reused by some definitional mechanism
* no automated test cases, you moron; create course and objectives with fixed strings and go on from there
