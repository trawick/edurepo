## Teacher

### General notes

* E-mail addresses and logins
  * A teacher must use a Google id (e-mail address) to log into the system to change data.  This e-mail address does not have to be provided to parents and students.
  * A teacher is identified by an e-mail address that they provide parents and students.  When registering as a teacher, provide this e-mail address for the teacher that parents and students already know.
  * When working at multiple schools or otherwise providing different e-mail addresses to parents and students in different classes, register once
for each different parent/student-visible e-mail address.  Use the proper e-mail address for each class.
  * Example:
    * Ms. Smith teaches three French classes for the Jones City School System and another three for the Jones County school system.  Here e-mail
addresses used by students at these schools are smith@jones.city.edu and smith@jones.county.edu.
    * Ms. Smith registers as two different teachers -- Ms. Smith (Jones City) with e-mail address smith@jones.city.edu, and Ms. Smith (Jones County) with
e-mail address smith@jones.county.edu.
    * The system will provide a dashboard for each of these two teachers registered by Ms. Smith.
    * Login is always performed with the Google id.

### Registration as a teacher

* Load http://edjective.org/ed/
* Click "Login with a Google account" if not already logged in.
* You may log in right away (http://edjective.org/ed/ immediately updated with a link to logout) or you may get a menu from Google allowing you to proceed.
* On the Setup drop-down menu, select "Register as a teacher".
* Specify the e-mail address which students and parents know about.
* Specify the name which students and parents use to refer to you.
  * If you are registering multiple teachers, such as for different schools or systems, include something in the name to distinguish them.  For example, "Ms. Smith (Jones County)"
or "Ms. Smith (Jones City)" would distinguish between classes in the Jones City and Jones County school systems.

* For class name, choose something that distinguishes it between other classes you each and other classes that your students have.  For example, "2nd Period 9th Grade World History"
is unique for you and your students.
* For Course id, use the curriculum identifier for this class.  If not known, open "Course and objective definitions" in another browser window and find the "Course id" to use here.
* Leave "Address of course repository" as-is unless instructed otherwise by your school.
